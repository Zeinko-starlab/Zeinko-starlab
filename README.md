Hello, i’m eleven and i’m passionate about programming, i only know python,
but i'm trying to learn C++ and i’m trying to make my biggest project yet, a program that when run takes pictures on your phone and sends them to you through discord
, the only hurdle i have right now is making opencv work on pydroid3.
